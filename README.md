# Quality Attributes and Test Driven Development

This is a presentation of the basic principles of Test Driven Development and the software quality attributes they have an effect on.

I did the presentation for some colleagues, fellow software developers, because I came to learn that every developer I spoke to on the topic, had a different understanding what TDD is, what is the process and what are the principles used.

In an attempt to align the understanding of TDD, I gave a presentation of my view on the process.
